        <h1>Italy</h1>
        <p>We struck Italy in the middle of a heatwave, yet still loved exploring the famous sights.</p>
        <h2>Venice</h2>

        <p>Venice, while crowded with tourists and a little smelly in places, is still an amazing place to visit. You need to get yourself lost in all the narrow streets and canals, and enjoy the hospitality of those few locals still left living on the island.</p>
        <h2>Amalfi</h2>
        <p><a href="amalfi.jpg">Amalfi Picture</a></p>
        <p>Amalfi is another one of those famous places you will see in thousands of photos but still have your breath taken away when you experience it first-hand.</p>
        <p>Another thing that can take your breath away is the insanely crowded, narrow and winding roads! Still, it is so beautiful that it is worth the driving stress.</p>
        <h2>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2>

        <p>Marvel at all the tourists taking the obligatory photo of themselves "holding up" the famous tower!</p>
        <p>Interestingly, there was a failed terrorist plot to topple the tower the same day we were visiting.</p>
